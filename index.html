                I never thought that I would find a career that I was trully
                pasionate about, until I stumbled across the world of software
                developement. It all started with creating a simple 'Hello
                World'. From that moment on, I knew that I had found what I
                would want to do for the rest of my life.

                  An interactive and fully responsive website built with React.
                  Provides the user with details about Quick Brew coffee shop.
                  This includes reviews, daily events, and an interactive menu.
                  I also created a shop with Commerce.js and connected it to
                  Stripe for the ability to accept payments.

                  A React application used to track the cardio activities of the
                  user. These activities can be compared with the goals that the
                  user sets. The users data is stored in a databse created with
                  PostgreSQL and connected to a server that was made with Node
                  and Express.
