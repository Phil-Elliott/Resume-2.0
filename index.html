              <p>
                I never thought that I would find a career that I was truly
                passionate about, until I stumbled across the world of software
                development. It all started with creating a simple 'Hello
                World'. From that moment on, I have been hooked.

                    An interactive and fully responsive website built with
                    React. Provides the user with details about Quick Brew
                    coffee shop. This includes reviews, daily events, and an
                    interactive menu. I also created a shop with Commerce.js and
                    connected it to Stripe for the ability to accept payments.

                    A React application used to track the cardio activities of
                    the user. These activities can be compared with the goals
                    that the user sets. The users data is stored in a database
                    created with PostgreSQL and connected to a server that was
                    made with Node and Express.

                  A Portfolio website built on React. Used Sass to create a
